# Flask-React-MovieSearch
 This was a pet project of mine while learning React and some knowledge of Python Flask
 Users can register, login and search for movies through api calls to the backend.
 The backend authenticates users and allows them to search only if they've logged in.
 Searched movies are passed to omdb api and the result is returned as a json object to the frontend.
